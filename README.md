# FastAPI Hornet

A modular, async security tool built with **FastAPI** — for scanning and auditing your own applications safely.

---

## Vision

FastAPI Hornet aims to be a lightweight, extensible security auditor you can use to automatically check:

- Web app security headers
- TLS/SSL configuration
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Secrets or misconfigurations in your own projects

**Note:** It's designed for ethical use — only scan systems you own or have permission to test.
